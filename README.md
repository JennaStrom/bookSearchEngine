## Description

## Installation
  You can visit the deployed link [here] (https://vast-wildwood-95099-109f82b9f0a2.herokuapp.com/) if you just want to use the application. Otherwise, you can clone the repo and run `npm install` to install all necessary dependencies. Run this in both the client and server folders. Then run `npm run develop` from the root directory to concurrently launch the server. It will now be available on `http://localhost:3001/`.

## Usage
  Once you have the website up and running you can create an account to log in. There is a search bar at the top where you can search for any book title. The options will show up below the search bar and you can click the save button if you would like to add it to your saved books. On the navigation bar, there is an option to click on your saved books. On that page, there is also a delete button on each book if you would like to remove it from your page. 
  
  Here are some screenshots of the website in action:
